# BJ-FM-js-chess-engine-fun

Purpose is to create a simple chess engine web app for novices to have fun playing a reasonably strong chess engine (or each other). 
The core codebase comes from chess guru Bill Jordan (billjordanchess / JavaScript-Chess).
Below you find a replication of what Bill Jordan writes as to his README file for the js chess engine.
